Hello again!  Turns out I am also a nerd, and couldn't help but use one of our new products to pull together a little website to keep track of the season.  You'll find some (hopefully) useful [information](/docs/intro) on who I am and my coaching philosophy.  Beyond that, there is also general information on practices and eventually game info/lineups.

My goal is to get the practice plan up before each week (didn't quite make it for this week).  This will show what we plan to work on each week, and if you miss a practice give you some ways to work at home.  I've taken some little league practice plans I've found and will make adjustments through the season based on our teams skills.

Let me know if there is anything else you'd like to see on here.

Happy Season! [Get started here](/docs/intro)
