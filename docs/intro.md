# Introduction

Welcome to the 2021 Erie Rec Baseball season.  My name is Michael Gearhardt, and I am so happy to get the opportunity to coach my two sons and your kids.  My wife, Diana, and I are working towards fielding our own famliy baseball team (though we may stop at basketball), expecting our 3rd son in late September.  I played baseball from this same age though competitive high school ball, and now try to play old man slow-pitch when I can.  I work as a CTO for Fathym, a software company out of Boulder, and am a Colorado native from Fort Collins.  

## Feedback

This is my first time as a youth athletics coach, and there are really only a couple facts in that a) I am not perfect, and b) I really have no clue what I am doing.  That said, stick with me and please provide your feedback.  Together we can make sure that all our kids have a fun and enjoyable season.
