# 5U Tee Ball - Practice 2 (6/9)

## Practice Goals

The players should be able to grip a ball correctly, successfully attempt an overhand throw, run the bases with guidance swing and play in the field.

## Practice Sequence

Following is the sequence we will use for practice.

### Warm-up/Stretching (5 Minutes)

Big league base running.

### Team Name (5 Minutes)

We will choose a team name.

### Introdution to positions (10 Minutes)

### Scrimmage (30 Minutes)

We'll divide into two teams and start actually scrimmaging a little.  On deck batter will start with some tee work, all other players stay in the dugout.
Explain rules to kids

- no lead-ofs, no steals, cannot leave base until ball is hit
- each player gets 5 pitches, no matter if they are balls or strikes
- after 5 pitches, the hitter gets one chance of the tee
  - this is not a punishment but just a way to keep the game moving
- if you are out, you need to come of the bases and return to the dugout

#### Hitting

- Hit soft balls into fence from tee, work on hands together on bat, swing hard
- No more than 5 swings and then rotate
