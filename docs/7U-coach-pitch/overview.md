# 7U Coach Pitch - Overview

Hello Erie 7U Coach Pitch parents!

With the age of our kids, winning will be fun, but not my main focus as the coach.  We have new players and experienced ones, and my goal will be to create an atmosphere where everyone can learn, have fun, and grow a passion for playing on a team (regardless of what that means for them in the future... music, school, or sports).  We'll work on the basics of the sport to start, and as the season goes on assess where everyone is at and try to work with each player to further develop their skills.

## Practice Information

Practices will be held on Wednesdays from 5pm to 6pm.  I am coaching this team, and my other son's TBall team at a different field.  So practices will generally end around 5:50 or 5:55 so I can get to the other field.  I would love for someone to volunteer as an assistant coach, and maybe we'll be able to grab the last 10 minutes of practice.

## Game Schedules

They will be posted to http://www.quickscores.com/erie, hopefully by this Tuesday.

## The Field Map

Practices and games will be held at [Columbine Mine Park](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Columbine+Mine+Park/@40.008128,-105.01728,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x93f5258dfbf511a3!8m2!3d40.008128!4d-105.01728)
