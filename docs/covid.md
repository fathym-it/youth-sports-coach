# Covid Thoughts

I know its been a long year and a half for all of us.  For some, this is a first foray/explorartion back towards some sense of normalcy.  For others, a light at the end of the tunnel that we may finally be breaking through.  No matter your situation, the safety of our kids and families is at the top of my mind.  we've all worked so hard to stay healthy, and its my goal to continue that as some families (mine included) are still in an immune compromised position.  Knowing our kids still can't get the vaccine, even though many of us parents are already do, my kids will be wearing their masks most of the time, specifically when in close proximity to other players (group huddles, dugout, and certain activities).

I know the rec department has their own policies on this that follow current government recommendations, so lets follow those and do what we can to go the extra mile for any families that need our support.
