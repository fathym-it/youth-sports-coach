# 5U Tee Ball - Overview

Hello Erie 5U Tee Ball parents!

With the age of our kids, winning will be fun, but not my main focus as the coach.  We have new players and if not new, newly experienced, and my goal will be to create an atmosphere where everyone can learn, have fun, and grow a passion for playing on a team (regardless of what that means for them in the future... music, school, or sports).  We'll work on the basics of the sport to start, and as the season goes on assess where everyone is at and try to work with each player to further develop their skills.

## Practice Information

Practices will be held on Wednesdays from 6pm to 7pm.  I am coaching this team, and my other son's Coach pitch team at different fields, so practices will generally start around 6:05 or 6:10 so I can get from the other field.  We'll shoot for around 45 minutes of practice (I think that's about all the time we'll get in attention from the little ones).

## Game Schedules

Game schedules are out and can be seen from the link in your email.
